# ducksearch
[Python] Do a DuckDuckGo search from a terminal, open links in a minimalist text view.
* Clean
* Simple
* Fast - For extra speed we use "duckduckgo.com/lite/" for lightweight responses.

* It's quick to type a query to do a search, just run the script with your search string at the end.
  * ex: "./ducksearch.py python curses library documentation" shows you results for "python curses documentation".
* To select the page you want from the results, type the number shown next to the result
